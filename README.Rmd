# fineng

The package provides routines to calculate option prices using different closed-form solutions and simulations

## Installation

You can install the released version of fineng with

``` r
devtools::install_github("fineng")
```

## New Updates on February 2019
- Simulation for Contiuous and Discrete Geometric Brownian Motion
- Finite-Difference Approximations, Pathwise derivative and Likelihood Ratio method for Option Greeks 
- Control Variates, Antithetic Variates and Stratified Sampling

## Plan for development
We plan to add the following features in the next releases:

- Heston Model with Newton-Cotes and Gaussian Quadrature (only Mid-point rule is currently supported)
- Simulation of symmetric random walk, scaled random walk and Jump Diffusion Process.
- Brownian Bridge
- American Option Pricing using Monte Carlo simulation
- Rcpp for high-performance computation.


## Usage

### Geometric Brownian Motion Simulation
``` {R GBM}
library(fineng)
SinglePath <- SimGBM(100,0.03,0.25,2,100,"discrete")
Path100 <- SimDGBM(100,0.03,0.25,2,100,10,"continuous")
Path100Terminal <- SimTGBM(100,0.03,0.25,2,100,10,"continuous")

head(SinglePath)
knitr::kable(head(Path100,10))
knitr::kable(Path100Terminal)
```


### Heston model
```{R example}
### Necessary Paramters
PutCall <- "Call"
# Option Properties
S = 100
K = 100
tau = 0.5
r = 0.03
q = 0.02
# Heston model Properties
kappa = 0.2
theta = 0.25
sigma = 0.3
lambda = 0
v0 = 0.02
rho = -0.8
# Mid-point Properties
N = 1000
a = 1e-5
b = 100

### Heston Price using Mid-point integration rule
result <- HestonPriceMP(PutCall, S, K, tau, r, q, kappa, theta, sigma, lambda, v0, rho, N, a, b)
print(result)

### Comparison with Black-Scholes model

BLresult <- BlackScholes("Call",S = 100, K = 100, tau = 0.5, r = 0.03, q = 0.02, sigma = 0.25)
print(BLresult)

```
